% Purpose:  
%       To perform SNN filtering of image.
%
% Input Variables:
%      asd      7x7 mask of input image
%     
%                                              
% Returned Results:
%       f       SNN filter output single value of a point
%                                        
%
% Processing Flow:
%      1.  Load 7x7 matrix asd which is a patch of the input image
%      2.  Take the absolute differences of opposite and symmetric values
%      with Xk(central value) and find the one with lesser difference and
%      keep it while discarding the other.
%      3.  The average of these values is found and assigned to Xk 
%
%  Restrictions/Notes:
%      None
%
%
%  The following functions are called:
%      None
